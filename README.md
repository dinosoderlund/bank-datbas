This project is a Banking System Simulation that combines SQL and Python to demonstrate both database modeling and real-time event generation.
The SQL part models a realistic banking database (customers, accounts, loans, transactions, etc.) and includes an audit log system for tracking user activity.
The Python part simulates fake user behavior (logins, clicks, logouts) and inserts these events into the audit log.
Together, they create a platform where you can analyze user activity patterns, detect anomalies, and build reports in tools like Power BI.
